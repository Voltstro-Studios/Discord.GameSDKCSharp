## Improvements

The major improvements that this C# wrapper include rather then the one provided by Discord's docs is:

* Cleaned-up source code
* XML Documents
* Is a library (Not just source code)

The source code of this wrapper seperate the parts of the wrapper into multiple `.cs` files, making it easier to naviage the code, rather than just having one massive 4000 lines `.cs` file.

---

The XML documents included also makes using the SDK easier, as you don't have to constantly refer back to Discord docs to know what a method does. The XML documents are based of what is on the Discord docs.

---

Discord only provides the C# code as just source code, not as a .dll file. This has its advantages that the code is embed into your game's code, but it can make it harder to update and using a package is easier.
